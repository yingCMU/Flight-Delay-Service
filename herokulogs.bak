Flight API
1.since the API I am calling do not require “origin airport” as a request parameter, but you can include it and I will figure out how to deal with it
http://localhost:9000/predictions/UA502/2013-12-01/SFO
2. I removed depTZ and arrTZ
3. I added an airlineName field like "United Airlines"

Recommendation API

1. to search for some categories, you might need bigger range. 
You can try this , I added some filter so it gives better result
http://localhost:9000/recommendations/-122.374889/37.618972/5/hotels/15


2. From the same picture, why isn’t the phone number in the result a formatted one? I found it on Yelp as "(877) 359-8474” However, I’m not sure about this, probably Yelp just return “display_phone” like this. Please correct my if I misunderstood.

Expected result: A formatted phone number like: “phone”: "(877) 359-8474"

3. There is an excess field named “categories”. Why is this field empty in every recommendation? However, the “category” field is good. I’ll use this for a display in the app.

Expected result: There should be no empty field.
