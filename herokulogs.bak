Flight API
1.since the API I am calling do not require “origin airport” as a request parameter, but you can include it and I will figure out how to deal with it

for some flightnumber, the result might be empty because the API I am using does not have that data.

2. I removed depTZ and arrTZ
3. I added an airlineName field like "United Airlines"

Recommendation API

1. to search for some categories, you might need bigger range. (by the way , the radius parameter is in miles)
You can try this , I added some filter so it gives better result

2. I can only show phone: "+1-650-692-3500"

3. There is an excess field named “categories”. Why is this field empty in every recommendation? However, the “category” field is good. I’ll use this for a display in the app.

Expected result: There should be no empty field.
